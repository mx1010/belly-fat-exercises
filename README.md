# Top exercises to get rid of belly fat

This mostly requires weights, once comfortable with the weights, increase by 6-12% more weight. At least 20 mins of cardio must be done prior to beginning workout.


## Exercises w/ no equipment required


#### Front Plank:

Lie prone on mat. Place forearms on mat, elbows under shoulders. Place legs together with forefeet on floor.

Raise body upward by straightening body in straight line. Hold position.

Muscles are exercised isometrically. Exercise can also be performed with straight supporting arms in pushup stance. Also see Spot Reduction Myth.

Works:
- Abs, Back

#### Bird Dog:

Kneel on mat on all fours with legs and hands slightly apart.

Raise arm out straight beside head while raising and extending leg on opposite side up out behind body. Lower arm and leg to floor to original position and repeat. Perform movement with opposite arm and leg.

Works:
- Spine, core, traps, biceps, neck

#### Basic crunch:

Lie supine on mat with lower legs on bench. Place hands behind neck or head.

Flex waist to raise upper torso from mat. Keep low back on mat and raise torso up as high as possible. Return until back of shoulders contact mat. Repeat.

Certain individuals may need to keep their neck in neutral position with space between their chin and sternum.

Works:
- Abs

#### Crunch up:

Lie supine on mat or floor with bent leg and arms pointed up.

Flex waist to raise upper torso from floor. Return until back of shoulders contact padded incline board. Repeat.

Hip may move slightly during exercise. Exercise can be performed with added resistance if needed, by holding weight above. Quadriceps were not listed under stabilizers since they are not under significant resistance. Certain individuals may need to keep their neck in neutral position with space between their chin and sternum

Works:
- Abs, obliques, hip flexors

#### Jack knife sit up:

Sit on floor or mat. Lie supine with hands to sides.

Simultaneously raise knees and torso until hips and knees are flexed. Return to starting position with waist, hips and knees extended. Repeat.

Begin each repetition with upper back on floor to allow abdominal muscles to work dynamically. The Rectus Abdominis and Obliques dynamically contract only when actual waist flexion occurs. With no waist flexion, Rectus Abdominis and External Oblique will only isometrically contract to stabilize pelvis and waist during hip flexion. 

Works:
- Abs, etc.

### Requires dumbells:

#### Chest Press:

Starting Position: Grasp two dumbbells and lie supine (on your back) on a flat bench with your feet firmly placed on the floor or upon a raised platform to allow you to maintain a flat or neutral (flat) spine. If working with a spotter, signal the spotter for assistance in handing you your the dumbbells.

Depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders down and back) to make firm contact with the bench. Your head, shoulders, butt and feet should make contact with the bench and floor/riser throughout the exercise. Signal your spotter for assistance in moving to your starting position. Grasp each dumbbell with a closed, pronated grip (palms facing forward, thumbs wrapped around the handle), press the dumbbells to a position level with or just below your eyes with the elbows fully extended. Maintain a neutral wrist position (avoid flexion/extension at the wrist joint).

Downward Phase: Inhale and slowly lower the dumbbells in unison and in a controlled movement towards your mid-chest, but moving slightly wider towards the armpits. Gently touch the dumbbells to your chest without bouncing, maintaining your neutral wrist position. Keep the elbows close to your sides (emphasizes more triceps) or flared out from the body (emphasizes more pectorals). Maintain all points of contact with the bench and floor/riser and avoid any arching in the low back.

Upward Phase: Exhale and gently press upwards to full elbow extension with the dumbbells positioned at or just below the level of your eyes. Maintain your points of contact with the bench and floor/riser, avoid arching your back during the lift and maintain neutral wrist position throughout the movement.

At the end of the set, signal your spotter to assist you in taking the dumbbells and maintain a firm grip until the dumbbells are taken from your hands.

Works:
- chest, biceps, triceps

#### Bent-over row:

Kneel over side of bench by placing knee and hand of supporting arm on bench. Position foot of opposite leg slightly back to side. Grasp dumbbell from floor.

Pull dumbbell to up to side until it makes contact with ribs or until upper arm is just beyond horizontal. Return until arm is extended and shoulder is stretched downward. Repeat and continue with opposite arm.

Allow scapula to articulate but do not rotate torso in effort to throw weight up. Torso should be close to horizontal. Positioning supporting knee and/or arm slightly forward or back will allow for proper levelling of torso. Torso may be positioned lower to allow for heavier dumbbell to make contact with floor, if desired.

Works:
- Back, shoulders, tricep, bicep

#### Seated overhead press:

Starting Position: Grasp the dumbbells in your hands and sit with your back against a back rest so that your head, shoulders and butt make contact with the bench. Place your feet firmly on the floor. Stiffen your torso by contracting your core and abdominal muscles ("bracing"). If working with a spotter, signal for assistance. Exhale and slowly lift the dumbbells to your shoulder level with a closed, pronated grip (palms facing forward and thumbs wrapped around the handles), with the dumbbells at shoulder-width or slightly wider and wrists in a neutral position (avoid flexion and extension of the wrists). Retract and depress your scapulae (pull down and back) and hold this scapulae position throughout the exercise.

Upward Phase: Exhale and press the dumbbells overhead in unison until your elbows are fully extended without any arching in your low back. Maintain your body contact with the bench, neutral wrist (avoid flexion and extension) and depressed, retracted scapulae positions. For more comfort through the range-of-motion keep your elbows pointed in front of you.

Downward Phase: Inhale and slowly lower the dumbbells in a controlled manner by flexing (bending) your elbows while maintaining a rigid torso, neutral wrists and contact with the bench and floor. Avoid simply yielding to gravity and consciously try to contract your lats and pull the dumbbells down towards you.

#### Bicep curl:

#### Triceps kickback:

Starting Position: Hold a dumbbell in your left hand and assume a split-stance position placing your right leg forward, but keeping your weight evenly distributed through the heels of both feet. Stiffen your torso by contracting your abdominal and core muscles ("bracing"). Place your right hand on your right thigh or knee and slowly lean forward, transferring most of your upper extremity body weight into that right side. Depress and retract your left scapula (pull your shoulder down and back) and maintain this position throughout the exercise. Your head should be aligned with your spine.

Position the your left upper arm parallel to, and close to, your torso. Bend your elbow to 90 degrees or at least to a point where your forearm hangs vertical to the floor.

Upward Phase: Exhale and slowly extend (straighten) your elbow by contracting your triceps muscles until your elbow is fully extended. Your upper arm should remain stationary next to your torso and not raised during the movement. Avoid any arching (sagging) in your low back or any rotation in your torso.
 
Downward Phase: Inhale and slowly return your arm to your starting position, without changing your torso position. Maintain your upper arm parallel and close to your torso.
